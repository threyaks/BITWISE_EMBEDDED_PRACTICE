# BITWISE_EMBEDDED_PRACTICE

This repository contains C implementations and practice exercises for **bitwise operations**, along with **unit tests** to verify correctness.  
It is designed for embedded systems learners who want to master low-level programming and bit manipulation techniques.

---

## 📌 Features
- Implementation of fundamental bitwise operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, bit shifts.
- Efficient algorithms like **Brian Kernighan’s algorithm** for counting set bits.
- Organized source files under `src/` and headers under `include/`.
- Unit tests to ensure correctness of each operation.
- Makefile for easy compilation and testing.
